# Description

Some python scripts.

Most scripts accept commandline arguments. For the details on these arguments, consult the `--help` argument

## bblToBib.py

Transform the `bbl` file (usually generated by `biblatex`) or a `tex` file that use such file into a `bib` file that can be used for e.g. `bibtex`

## checkVirusTotal.py

Compute some hashes and search the MD5 hash on VirusTotal. Optionally scan with Windows Defender

## decodeClipboardQRCode.py

Scan image in clipboard and decode the QR code within, if any. Requires `opencv-python`, `pillow`, and `numpy`

## expandMdMathMacro.py

Read a `Markdown` file that uses math macros (stored as `json` format) and transform to plain math `KaTeX` math commands. Also allow transforming math commands with image links, or transform the file into a `HTML` file that can be rendered with `MathML` or GitHub-previewable `IPython` notebook.

Requires `pandoc` in path for file format transforming.

## extractBib.py

Extract entries in a `bib` file that are cited in the given `TeX` file and put them to `stdout` or put them in a separete file.

## extractUMM.py

Extract commands from my `usefulmathmacro` macros that are used in a given `TeX` file and output them to `stdout` or embed the commands back in the file.

## fetchDocMetadata.py

Fetch the metadata of a document identifier and display its metadata in `stdout`. Cut-down version of the same functionality in `shdl`. Useful for debugging `shdl`

Currently only support `doi`, `arxiv`, and `jstor`.

## getExchangeRate.py

Get the exchange rate from one currency to another. Does not guarantee data accuracy.

Available backends are [currency-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api) and [European Central Bank](https://sdw-wsrest.ecb.europa.eu/help/)

## getFontList.py

A simple script wrapping around `fc-list`

## getLinksInHTML.py

Parse the given page and extract all links. Useful for discovering links in CTF.

## hxscript.py

Some simple python script I have written for practising CTF.

## ipythonInitScript.py

Import some python packages in `ipython` for scicomp. Just run the script after `ipython` is initiated.

## musicKeyboard.py

A mini project I did. Use your keyboard to play some musics. Dropped because of NKRO.

Uses code from `personalPylib_audio.py`. 

## personalPylib_np.py

Same as `personalPylib.py` but relies on `numpy`

## paperNameNormalizer.py

Same as `fetchDocMetadata.py` but for geting the `autoname`. Also for debugging `shdl`

## personalPylib_audio.py

A simple python I use to generate some sounds. Uses `numpy`

## personalPylib.py

Some python scripts I have written. May be used in other scripts.

## previewLatex.py

A function that renders `SageMath` `latex` output into image and put it on console in [iTerm2 image sequence](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)

The template latex content is edited from TeXStudio preview latex file. Requires `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `amsfonts`, `preview`, `varwidth` packages

Should work on all terminal emulators that support the iTerm2 image protocol, but currently on Windows only work with the default `mintty` terminal. Not sure why

## pipRemovable.py

A python script to check the dependencies of packages. Depends on `pip` and `pipdeptree >= 0.5.0` (ironically). 

**WARNING** the functionality depends on `pipdeptree`. If `pipdeptree` does not detect dependencies correctly (e.g. as optional), this script also gives incorrect answers. Check the dependencies yourself before actually uninstalling packages.

## ReplotOnZoom.py

A simple class that replots the bitmap on zooming and paning

## wormholeQR.py

Read the `wormhole send` code and generate a QR code that can be read by `wormhole-william`. Use for transferring files from computer to cellphone with `wormhole(-william)`
