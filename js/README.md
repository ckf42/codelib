Some userscripts I have written.

Most of them *should* be [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)-compatible.

## Get github repo size.js

Show the estimated repo size on the `Download ZIP` button on Github repo page. The size is reported by Github api and seems to be inaccurate.

## restrict google search result language.js

Change the language of Google search result by changing the query parameter

To add new language, just modify the `langCodeDict` with the name for display and the corresponding IETF tag
