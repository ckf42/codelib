Some userscripts I have written.

Most of them *should* be [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)-compatible. Have not tested on other userscript managers.

## AoC show full star ratio.js 

Show the ratio of getting two stars on each question on statistic page of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Force zh locale on wikipedia.js 

Enforce a specific language variant in [Chinese wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/)

## Get github repo size.js

Show the estimated repo size on the `Download ZIP` button on Github repo page. The size is reported by Github api and seems to be inaccurate.

## HN highlight users.js 

Highlight usernames on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to note users who comments multiple times in the same post.

## restrict google search result language.js

Change the language of Google search result by changing the query parameter

To add new language, just modify the `langCodeDict` with the name for display and the corresponding IETF tag
